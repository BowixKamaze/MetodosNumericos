Numerical methods 

These Scripts are useful to search for roots or if we want to approximate a numerical value, we can use some numerical approximations methods. If we want to know
what is the derivative value and we have not a formula to apply the common rules or we don't have a way to find it, we can approximate it through numerical methods. 
The same happens if we want to search for an integral Value. We will have some decimal error, but we can minimize that eror and do a good approach. 
To summarize, these scripts are related to numerical approximations with a low error.
